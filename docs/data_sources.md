### ROCCC Assessment

| Criterion  | Assessment                                                                                       |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **R**      | **Reliable**: The dataset comes from Fitbit users who consented to uploading their personal information and is hosted on a reputable platform (Kaggle). |
| **O**      | **Original**: While the data is not originally from Fitbit, it was generated by users who voluntarily submitted their personal tracker information in response to a survey distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will assume it to be original for our analysis. |
| **C**      | **Comprehensive**: Covers a variety of user habits, though limited by a small sample size.       |
| **C**      | **Current**: Although the data may be outdated, we will assume it is relevant and applicable for the current analysis. |
| **C**      | **Cited**: Properly cited with source information.                                             |

### Key Tasks
- Verified the dataset's location and assessed ROCCC criteria.

### Dataset Issues
- **Lack of Description:** The dataset lacks detailed descriptions of columns and overall documentation, making interpretation challenging.
- **Limited Sample Size:** The dataset is based on only 30 respondents, which may not effectively represent the broader population.
